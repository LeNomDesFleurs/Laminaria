# *Laminaria*, a compagnon for [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca)

This is a learning repo, using rust to receive MIDI and generate sound, 
using channels and mutex to learn thread concurrency.

It is intended to be use in the terminal with ORCA (using it's base 36 values).

This will maybe become a crate to create little toy synth more easily, with a default interface.

Lib :
- cpal for audio
- midir for midi
- cross term for terminal I/O
